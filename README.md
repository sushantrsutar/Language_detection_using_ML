Language detection system refers to the process of recognising the given natural 
language by the machine or in other ways, it is a powerful model which will detect 
specific language with high performance. This type of prediction and detection is 
mainly used in translation apps to automatically detect language types of text by top 
MNC such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and many more. It will reduce human efforts. 
There are several existing solutions available for language detection and they have their 
own disadvantages such as due to the limited number of data loaded in the system 
language detection is not 100% reliable. The software would be unable to distinguish 
languages with only a few words and similar words having different meanings in 
various native languages. It would be hard for the system to provide any kind of 
information if no such words exist in the currently loaded data set. To overcome from 
these issues, a robust Machine learning model has been proposed which will detect the 
language effectively. The Proposed system will aim to deliver the best results as 
compared to the traditional language detection system.
